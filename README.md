# Coinstrip

I recreated a version of the Silver Dollar Game, in which two players take turns moving an n number of coins
randomly dispersed throughout the board to the leftmost spaces. With each player deciding which coin to move and the 
number of spaces to move it (as long as it does not jump over any coins to its left), the winner is the player who moves
the last coin into the correct place.
